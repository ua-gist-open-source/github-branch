# Assignment: GitHub Branch
## Background
Read:
- [Branches](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches)
- [Pull requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

This Repo was created with a single, `master` branch, which is protected, meaning you can't commit changes to it. In the
software development world, maintainers typically maintain a `master` branch and create alternative branches which can
contain new features, bug fixes, etc. that need to be tested extensively before being merged back into the `master` branch.
In larger software projects there are extensive tests and tooling set up to automatically test branches to see if they
can be safely merged into master and only after passing these tests AND after review by a Maintainer of the project
can the changes be adopted into `master`.

## Directions

1. Your assignment is to create a new branch named `my-branch` and in that branch, modify this document by entering your 
branch name below:

The name of my branch is: 

2. When you have created your branch with this file modified above, create a *Pull Request* to merge your new branch into `master`.
Be sure to give a description so that the *Reviewer* knows what you are creating, fixing, deleting, or improving. When you submit 
your Pull Request you will see that a Review is required and that Merging is blocked.

3. Once you have created your *Pull Request*, let the instructor know and thet will review it. You should receive a notification (See your [Settings](https://github.com/settings/notifications))
